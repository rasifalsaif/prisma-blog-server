## 📊 Database Schema

The project uses a structured relational schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

- **User**: Stores profiles, roles (Admin/User), and status (Active/Inactive).
- **Post**: Manages blog content, status (Draft/Published), views, and tags.
- **Comment**: Handles user interaction with posts, including nested replies and moderation states.
- **Auth Related**: `Session`, `Account`, and `Verification` tables for secure identity management.
